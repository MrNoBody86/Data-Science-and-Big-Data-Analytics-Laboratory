## Group A

### 1. [Data Wrangling I](https://github.com/MrNoBody86/Data-Science-and-Big-Data-Analytics-Laboratory/blob/3c48c228184a2b808daad83b0cae8fb794035eb7/A1.ipynb)
Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
1. Import all the required Python Libraries.
2. Locate an open source data from the web (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com). Provide a clear
 description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the web site).
3. Load the Dataset into pandas dataframe.
4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing values in the data using pandas isnull(), describe()
function to get some initial statistics. Provide variable descriptions. Types of variables etc.
Check the dimensions of the data frame.
5. Data Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize the types of variables by checking
the data types (i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the
data set. If variables are not in the correct data type, apply proper type conversions.
6. Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python.
In addition to the codes and outputs, explain every operation that you do in the above steps and
explain everything that you do to import/read/scrape the data set.

### 2. [Data wrangling II](https://github.com/MrNoBody86/Data-Science-and-Big-Data-Analytics-Laboratory/tree/d67248057891be3047398574be00c315a2ab2f91/A2)
Create an “Academic performance” dataset of students and perform the following operations using
Python.
1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values and/or
inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them.
2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable
techniques to deal with them.
3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this
transformation should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for better
understanding of the variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear one, or to
decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution.
